    <!-- FORMS IN HTML 
       -> we use form element to create form.
       -> we use <label> and <input> tags for forms.
       -> Forms are practiced in contactme.html..
       -> we can check out other attributes of forms in MDN web docs or in W3schools.
       -> we can also refer to the types of inputs like checkbox,text,color,etc.
       -> we can use "mailto:(email)" in "action" attribute in form element. This will open default mail with
          email address and the info we put in form will be transferred to mail..
       -> we can use attribute 'enctype' (encoding type) and set it to "text/plain" in form element. 
       -> This will specify that the data in our form is encoded in plain text. After this, we will only 
          have plain text in mail instead of % signs.
       -> we can also use 'name' attribute in <input> element. we can set name as "yourName". This "yourName" 
          will show as a Label in a mail that we covered in above point. 
       -> Note: Textarea is an element inside form not a input type.
                If you do not mention 'method' attribute as "post" inside form element, then data won't be 
                posted in email..

    <!-- PUBLISHING WEBSITE USING GITHUB.-->
    <!-- -> sign up for github on web. 
         -> we'll learn what is github in detail in next sections.
         -> repository is a folder on cloud which contain all project files. it can be public and private.
